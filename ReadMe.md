The app is teaching how to create and manipulate list in python.
Besides lists the following are used:

  input command (take in user input)
  creating of string and using the format command (to allow for variable input)
  using if/elif/else statements for logic
  use of capitalize command to make first letter of string captial
  strip command (to remove white space)
  lower command (to make letter lower case)
